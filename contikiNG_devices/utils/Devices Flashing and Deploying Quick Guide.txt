Device Flashing (nordic nrf52840)
===============

1) Physically disconnect every device.

2) Plug in the device to be flashed and wait for it to be recognized by Windows.

3) Connect the device to the VM via the "devices" drop-down menu (nordic nrf52840 ...).

4) Start the docker in a terminal (in my case, docker start -ai fda9be9d29b8).

5) Navigate to the directory containing the firmware to be flashed (e.g. "actuator" or "sensor").

6) Run the following command:

   make TARGET=nrf52840 BOARD=dongle [C_SOURCE_FILE_NAME].dfu-upload PORT=/dev/ttyACM0     (e.g. actuator.dfu-upload or sensor.dfu-upload)

   The flashing process will begin, but, because of Windows shenanigans in recognizing a new device, it will be disconnected from the VM, causing it to be stuck in flash mode (blinking red light).

7) Reconnect the device to the VM via the "devices" drop-down menu (nordic nrf52840 ...).

8) Re-run the command at point 6), which now will successfully flash the device (after which it must be reconnected again to the VM as 7), if needed)



System Deployment (nordic nrf52840)
=================

1) Physically disconnect every device.

2) Plug in the border-router device and wait for it to be recognized by Windows.

3) Connect the border-router to the VM via the "devices" drop-down menu (nordic nrf52840 ...).

4) Start the docker in a terminal (in my case, docker start -ai fda9be9d29b8).

5) Navigate to the directory containing the border-router firmware to be flashed (in my case, /home/osboxes/contiki-ng/SafeTunnels/contikiNG_devices/src/border-router)

6) Run the command

   make TARGET=nrf52840 BOARD=dongle PORT=/dev/ttyACM0 connect-router

   Which will ask for the superuser's password and, if successful, will print the border router's global prefix and unicast IPv6 address (in my case, fd00::f6ce:36b3:3f0b:0956)

7) Connect the other devices to a nearby USB port, they do not need to be connected to the VM.
